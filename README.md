## This is just basic todo app project

to get a hang of React syntax and to prepare myself to start something a little [bigger](https://github.com/bartekszajna/sudoku_app_design). Not for portfolio.

Includes typical features, as well as local storage management and todos sorting in terms of completed/incompleted. Very simple styling included. There are separate branches named accordingly to state management method used in the project. For Redux I kept everything basic without react-redux package for now.
