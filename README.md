## This is just basic todo app project

to get a hang of React syntax and to prepare myself to start something a little [bigger](https://github.com/bartekszajna/sudoku_app_design). Not for portfolio.

Includes typical features, as well as local storage management and todos sorting in terms of completed/incompleted. Very simple styling included. First commit contains version with just some local state management. Next one will be re-writed for Redux
